Rank	Gene	Genomic Alterations	Locus	Altered frequency (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2015)	Biological function in prostate cancer	References
5	TP53	Deletion/mutation	17p13.1	8.0%	Responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism	Barbieri et al. 2012; Beltran et al. 2016b; Mu et al. 2017
9	MYC	Amplification	8q24.21	8.0%	Contributes to prostate cancer by directly activating the transcription of protumorigenic factors involved in cell growth and proliferation	Jenkins et al. 1997; Ellwood-Yen et al. 2003
33	FOXA1	Mutation	14q21.1	6.0%	Required for epithelial cell differentiation in murine prostate and promotes cell cycle progression in CRPC	Zhang et al. 2011a; Barbieri et al. 2012
59	AR	Amplification/mutations/splicing variants	Xq12	1.2%	A steroid hormone-activated transcription factor, which remains important in development; amplification and mutations of AR contribute to the progression of prostate cancer and the failure of ADT by allowing constitutive activation of the AR pathway	Taplin et al. 1995; Visakorpi et al. 1995
80	SMAD4	Deletion/mutation	18q21.2	3.0%	Tumor suppressor; acts as a downstream effector of the TGFbeta pathway, regulates gene transcription, inhibits epithelial cell proliferation, and remodels the TME	Ding et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2016a
95	ATM	Deletion/mutation	11q22.3	7.0%	One of the master controllers of the cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways that are required for cell response to DNA damage and for genome stability	Pritchard et al. 2016; Fraser et al. 2017
