Rank	Gene	Genomic Alterations	Locus	Altered frequency (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2015)	Biological function in prostate cancer	References
4	TP53	Deletion/mutation	17p13.1	8.0%	Responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism	Barbieri et al. 2012; Beltran et al. 2016b; Mu et al. 2017
9	MYC	Amplification	8q24.21	8.0%	Contributes to prostate cancer by directly activating the transcription of protumorigenic factors involved in cell growth and proliferation	Jenkins et al. 1997; Ellwood-Yen et al. 2003
34	FOXA1	Mutation	14q21.1	6.0%	Required for epithelial cell differentiation in murine prostate and promotes cell cycle progression in CRPC	Zhang et al. 2011a; Barbieri et al. 2012
58	AR	Amplification/mutations/splicing variants	Xq12	1.2%	A steroid hormone-activated transcription factor, which remains important in development; amplification and mutations of AR contribute to the progression of prostate cancer and the failure of ADT by allowing constitutive activation of the AR pathway	Taplin et al. 1995; Visakorpi et al. 1995
73	BRCA1	Deletion/mutation	17q21.31	1.2%	Play key roles in transcription, DNA repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination. Mateo et al. 2015	
74	ATM	Deletion/mutation	11q22.3	7.0%	One of the master controllers of the cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways that are required for cell response to DNA damage and for genome stability	Pritchard et al. 2016; Fraser et al. 2017
83	SMAD4	Deletion/mutation	18q21.2	3.0%	Tumor suppressor; acts as a downstream effector of the TGFbeta pathway, regulates gene transcription, inhibits epithelial cell proliferation, and remodels the TME	Ding et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2016a
92	PTEN	Deletion/mutation	10q23.31	17.0%	Suppresses the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway to regulate cell survival, proliferation, and energy metabolism	Wang et al. 2003; Barbieri et al. 2012; Grasso et al. 2012
